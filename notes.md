# My DS Notes

This is a repository for my notes
Version Control - we use Git
Free, open source distributed program for tracking source code, being a time machine, and enabling parallel universes

If somebody adds to your history of work it doesn’t add a branch

Repository - a plain old folder tracked by Git

A Commit - one or changes to one or more files
	Commit language is the English version of your commit instead of the alphanumeric

A Push - an upload of one or more commits to another computer for backup
	You have to do this manually, it’s like saving a game before a boss
	
A Pull - a download from a computer

Local - whatever computer your physically in front of.
Remote - computer or server where your pushed changes are uploaded

There’s no icon for Git but it works from your terminal

Add or stage - are like adding files to an envelope before committing 

Clone - copies an entire repository folder while still retaining its repository status instead of just copying the folder

How to make a new repository
You can’t put spaces in a repo name, use underscores

SSH key is more secure than HTTPS

Git add (file name) to add it to the tracked files for Git.  Once committed it’ll be tracked by Git
Instead of doing “git add (folder name)” you can do “git add .” instead

We push at least 2 commits per day here at CodeUp, usually before lunch and before you leave.

You can push all changes at once by using “push push push”

Wherever you clone becomes the parent repository of your git code
You want to avoid nesting repository within a repository
You can uncommit something, like if you accidentally put a password in the code and need to erase your history
